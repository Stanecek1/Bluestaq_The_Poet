clone the repository
cd into the folder with the package.json file
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

somethings that I would improve or change given the time. 

1) Show all the author data and poems in cards on author select, instead of selecting and displaying a single poem.
2) add More styling
3) Add fade in / fade outs and other animations
4) Caching poems so the app doesnt have to fetch the same poem multiple times
5) There is a bug that causes an error if the title of a poem contians a '/'
