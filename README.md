clone the repository
cd into the folder with the package.json file
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

somethings that i would improve or change given the time. 

1) show all the author data and poems in cards on author select, instead of selecting and displaying a single poem.
2) more styling
3) fade in / fade out and other animations
4) caching peoms so the app doesnt have to fetch the same poem multiple times
